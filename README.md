# units
game of life style haxe project

-units collect resources and build buildings

-uses a 2d pathfinding algorithm, constrained loosely to a tile grid. 

-takes a maze-making algorithm (/man/HxPrimMaze.hx [[source](https://github.com/gamepopper/MAN-Haxe)]) to restrict where buildings can be built, and prevent units from walling themselves in.
